# Wix Mobile Kickstart

The Mobile Kickstart course is a self-learning course that helps you learn everything you need to know before diving into writing production code in React Native. This course is part of the official onboarding plan for every new developer in the Wix Mobile Guild.

The Kickstart course is divided into 2 sections:

## 1. Learn the basics

Helps you untangle the environment setup, learn basics or refresh your knowledge of JS, React, Node, Git, etc. If you already feel comfortable with these subjects,you can jump straight into the next section.

* [Environment setup](/docs/Basics.enviromentSetup.md)
* [Intro to Git & GitHub](/docs/Basics.IntroToGit.md)
* [JS](/docs/Basics.JavaScript.md)
* [React Native](/docs/Basics.ReactNative.md)


## 2. Build your first app

This step by step guide teaches you the best practices and open source tools that we are using at Wix while building a simple blog app.

1. [Intro](/docs/App.Intro.md)
2. [Build the **app navigation**](/docs/App.Navigation.md)(with React-native-navigation)
3. [Adding the **app business logic** and **state management**](/docs/App.Remx.md)(with Remx)
4. [**Style** the app](/docs/App.UiLib.md) (with react-native-ui-lib)
5. [Add **e2e tests**](/docs/App.e2e.md) (with Detox)
