# Wix Mobile Kickstart

The Mobile Kickstart course is a self-learning course that helps you learn everything you need to know before diving into writing production code in React Native. This course is part of the official onboarding plan for every new developer in the Wix Mobile Guild. 

The Kickstart course is divided into 2 sections:

1. [**Learn the basics**](https://github.com/wix-playground/wix-mobile-crash-course/wiki/Building-you-first-app---Intro) - helps you untangle the environment setup, learn basics or refresh your knowledge of JS, React Native, etc.

2. [**Build your first app**](https://github.com/wix-playground/wix-mobile-crash-course/wiki/Building-you-first-app---Intro) - this step by step guide teaches you the best practices and open source tools that we are using at Wix while building a simple app. Here is how our app will look:

So head over to the repo [**Wiki**](https://github.com/wix-playground/wix-mobile-crash-course/wiki) and let's start. ðŸš€

> Note: The most important thing about any onboarding course, is to keep it up to date. We encourage the old Scout's rule: "Leave the campground cleaner than you found it". If you find any issues or out of date content, please open an issue and we will take care of it. Thanks!
