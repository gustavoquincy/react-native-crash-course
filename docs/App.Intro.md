# Building Your First App

Itâ€™s time to build your first React Native app! In this section, we will build a blog app together from scratch.

## About the App

The app will display a list of posts and the user will be able to add posts, view and delete them. Here is how itâ€™s going to look:

The code for the final project can be found [here](https://github.com/wix-playground/wix-mobile-crash-course). 

## About this Tutorial

We will follow this workflow, step-by-step:

1. [Build the **app navigation**](App.Navigation.md)(with React-native-navigation)
2. [Adding the **app business logic** and **state management**](App.Remx.md)(with Remx)
3. [**Style** the app](App.UiLib.md) (with react-native-ui-lib)
4. [Add **e2e tests**](App.e2e.md) (with Detox)
5. [Add **unit tests**](App.tests.md) (with Jest)


Each step is comprised of 2 parts:

* **Preliminaries** - includes links to the best resources to learn from. Please make sure not to spend too much time on those links. Feel free to skip it if you are already familiar with the subject.
* **Hands-on** - we will build together the app step by step, applying the best practices in each step and exploring the most important features of the libraries that we are using.

> __**Note:**__ *Each step depends on the previous one, so even if you choose to skip the theoretical "Perliminaries" part, make sure to go through the hands-on parts.*

If you feel like you want to give your app your own twist, go for it! Check out these API's that you can use:
* [SpaceX Launches](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)
* [Star Wars data](https://swapi.co/)
* [Weather API](https://www.metaweather.com/api/)  or [Open weather map](http://openweathermap.org/current) 
* [Cryptocurrency prices API](https://www.coindesk.com/api/)
* [Food & recipes API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)  (need to do freemium subscribe here)
* [Twitter search API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search)
* [Movie Database api](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
* [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)

We will use our own simple local server that we will create (Just to make sure that we are not dependent on any external api and that we have a full REST api).

## Preliminaries
Before you dive into this tutorial, you should feel comfortable with the basics of JS and React.

We recommend going over the Basics section in the [onboarding](https://github.com/wix-playground/wix-mobile-crash-course#1-learn-the-basics) plan before you start. It will help you untangle the environment setup, learn or refresh your basic knowledge of JS, React, Node, Git, etc .

If you choose to dive straight into this section and start building your app, the minimum requirement is to complete the official [React Native Getting Started guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) (Choose building project with Native code and not quick start), to install and build your first Hello world app and ensure that your environment setup is ready.

Have fun ðŸš€
